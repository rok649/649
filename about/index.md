I am an independent software developer currently based in China.I'm a graduate student at Soochow University. Most of my work is open source and publicly available on <highlight :value="'GitHub'" :link="'https://github.com/zh601095001/'"/>. If you happen to benefit from my OSS work, you can support me financially via GitHub Sponsors.

You can follow me on <highlight :value="'Twitter'"/> where I mostly tweet about React and frontend technologies. If you happen to speak Chinese, my Chinese name is 赵浩 (zhào hào). You can also find me on <highlight :value="'微博'"/> and <highlight :value="'知乎'"/>.
